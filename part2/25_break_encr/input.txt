This frequency distribution means that if you know (or suspect)
that a file contains English text encrypted with a Caesar Cipher,
you can simply count the frequency of all letters in it, and guess
that the letter which occurs most often is 'e'.   Once you know
which letter is 'e', you can backsolve for the key and decrypt
the file.  Note that in practice this requires a large enough
text that "the law of large numbers" applies---and while it is
not guaranteed to work, it typically does
